# DinoRunDeepQLearning
All the attempts of doing this were either not playing the real chrome dino run or were out-dated and just not good(would take way too much time to train). My one learns pretty quickly and is quite good. 

Run the train.py file to train the dino. It will automatically save models so you can do future further training. Run test.py to test your model.

Also if you want me to add comments to better explain my code let me know or just expand my readme.
